Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

F = k|q1||q2| / r^2
To determine q1, use the formula q = total area * charge per unit area, which is 2.9 x 3.14 x 2.52 x 10-18 = 56.91 x 10-18 as q1 = q2.
F = k q2 / r2 F = k 56.91 x 10 36 / 9 == 3.59 x 10 34 x k 3118864
