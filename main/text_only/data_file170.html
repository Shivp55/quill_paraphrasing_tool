Also, this technology certainly had an impact on one of the most common broad applications of the computer age - the word processing software which is used in all computers and laptops.<br/>Word Processing software is more advanced than typewriters in many features and characteristics. This software allows text, sentences, paragraphs, and pages to be moved around to the person’s liking and even assists the writer in making corrections; the most modern programs include a spellcheck and grammar check feature, which is a very valuable and essential tool needed when writing. Furthermore, this software has a thesaurus which offers synonyms for desired words and can add a more diverse range of vocabulary to someone’s word choices. Word Processing Software also stores documents so that they can be accessed at any time.<br/><br/><br/>[The sentence about storing documents could be a separate paragraph. It does not really fit with this paragraph, and you could expand this sentence to discuss the possibilities this allows for collaboration between multiple people, the ability to send an digital copy of a document to another person, and fact that future generations will have access to this documents without having to worry about decay.]</div><div class="true" style="display:None;"><p>3119486</p></div> <script>
