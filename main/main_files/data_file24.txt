Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

Left of the -10uC charge in I
Left of the -10uC charge in I
the potential depend on charge directly and distance inversely for the potential to cancel each other potential due to positive charge must be equal to that of a negative charge.
thus, kq1/r1=kq2/r2.
If q1>q2, then the same reasoning for the electric field 3118902 also applies if r1>r2.
