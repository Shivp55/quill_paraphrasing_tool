Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

We are aware that the mass deposited is provided by the electrochemical equation m = Zit z, where "it" is the current and so 5 = 96500. (q)
q = 5.181*10-5 or ne = 5.181*10-5 or n = 5.181*10-5 / 1.6*10-19 = 3.328*1014 electrons
