Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

mass Cu + mass Pb = 4360 g, where V is equal to mass / density. Volume of Cu (let x) = 8.94 g/cm Cu = mass / 8.94 density Pb (let y)= 11.34 g/cm3 volume Pb = mass / 11.34 x + y = 4360 x / 8.94 + y / 11.34 = 427 x = 4360 - y = 42914 - 2.4 y = - 6528 y = 2720 g => 2.72 Kg mass Cu = 4.36 - 2.72 = 1.64 Kg\s% Cu = 1.64 x 100/ 4.36 =38.1%\s3118388
