Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

e = cos(isin) + I
ln(cos?+isin?) is obtained by applying an apple logarithm to both sides with regard to base e.
compare and contrast with regard to I We obtain (d/d?) on both sides of the equation. ln(cos?+isin?)=i thus demonstrated
b) By integrating the aforementioned equation, we obtain ln(cos?+isin?)=i?+C, where C is an arbitrary constant maintained at? = 0. This results in 0 =C 3119420.
