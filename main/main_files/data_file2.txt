Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

According to the preceding statement, if two charges are separated by an infinite distance, their electric potential energy will be equal to zero; but, if they are separated by a distance r, value =kq1q2/r, then u>0; yet, if any o, then u0 3118726.
