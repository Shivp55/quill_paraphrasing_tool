Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

1-e^-t(0<t<pi) = (1 - e(-t))(u(t-€) - u(t) = u(t-€) - u(t) - e(-t)u(t-€) + e(-t)u (t)
The transform is thus:
3119590 = e(-€s)/s - 1/s - e(-€)e(-€s)/(s+1) + 1/(s+1)
