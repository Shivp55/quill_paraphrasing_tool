This information is in part the basis for decision-making. (1) Explain how to perform a horizontal analysis of financial statements (10 points) and (2) provide an example of how the results of this analysis could be used to make business decisions</p><br/></div><div class="container"><p><strong>Answer</strong></p><p>Total answers posted by the expert is: 2508</p>Comparison of two or more year's financial data is known as horizontal analysis, or trend analysis.<br/>Horizontal analysis is facilitated by showing changes between years in both dollar and percentage form as has been done in the example below. Showing changes in dollar form helps the analyst focus on key factors t hat have affected profitability or financial position. Observe in the example that sales for 2003 were up $4 million over 2001, but that this increase in sales was more than negated by a $4.5million increase in cost of goods sold. Showing changes between years in percentage form helps the analyst to gain perspective and to gain a feel for the significance of the changes that are taking place. For example a $1 million increase in sales is much more significant if the prior year's sales were $2 million than if the prior year's sales were $20 million. In the first situation, the increase would be 50% that is undoubtedly a significant increase for any firm. In the second situation, the increase would be 6% that is just a reflection of normal progress.<br/>Horizontal analysis of financial statements can also be carried out by computing trend percentages<br/>.</div><div class="true" style="display:None;"><p>3118464</p></div> <script>
