Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

The pH of blood is 7.4. Ammonia (NH3) has a pKa value of 9.3, which makes it more likely to draw a hydrogen from the blood and exist as an ammonium cation (NH4+). The charged nature of this molecule makes passive transport over hydrophobic lipid membranes improbable. Ammonium must instead be transported across the membrane through channels or membrane transport proteins.
