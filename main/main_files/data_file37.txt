Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

Water's isothermal compressibility coefficient is equal to 4.6*10-10 Pa1 (or K).
Pressure change: delta P = 689475729 Pa or 100*103 psi
Hence, deltaV/V = delta P * K = 0.3172 and the resulting percent change is 31.72% 3119104
