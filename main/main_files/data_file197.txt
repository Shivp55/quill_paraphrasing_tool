Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

a.) Find the revenue function R(q), the Profit function P(q), the marginal revenue function R'(q), and marginal cost C'(q). Find the production level q at which P(q) is at its highest level.
Profit P(q)=q((37-2q)-(3q2+5q+75))=-3q3-7q2-38q, where R(q)=q*(37-2q)=37q-2q2
Marginal revenue = (dR/dq) = 37-4q and marginal cost = (dC/dq) = 6q+5
When dP/dq=0, P(q) is maximised.
I'm not sure about the p(q),C(q) functions since we're getting a loss.
