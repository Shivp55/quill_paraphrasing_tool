Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

B) P(75<x<82)= P(x<82) P (x = 75) = P (z = 0.57) - P (z = -1.43) = 0.7157-0.0764=0.6393 c) P(x>88) equals P(z>2.29) = 1-P(z2.29) = 1-0.9890 = 0.011 3119318
