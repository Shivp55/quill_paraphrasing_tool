Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

What is the air pressure at the summit of Mount McKinley, which is 6194 metres (20,320 feet) high, in relation to the pressure at sea level?
p/p0 *100 =e^0.00012*6194=21%
A typical commercial jet's maximum cruising altitude is around 12,000 metres (about 39,000 feet). What percentage of sea level is the air pressure at that altitude?
p/p0 *100 =e^0.00012*12000=42%\s3120090
