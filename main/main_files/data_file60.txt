Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

As there are no constants in this problem, PV=nRT cannot be used to solve it. So, despite being legitimate, it is not a very useful form.
PV^n=constant
Anytime an adiabatic process is involved, you should KNOW this cold. You may now substitute P as nRT/V using this and the PV=nRT relations to obtain another important adiabatic relation, namely TVn-1=constant 3118426.
