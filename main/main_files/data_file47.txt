Answer

The typewriter had a significant social impact. America introduced the typewriter into society, which increased its appeal and made the country well-known to "other countries" and provided meaning to its written records. The increased production of books and literary articles led to the global dissemination of important information.
Typewriters made it easier and faster for writers and a wide range of other individuals to produce written materials. The work produced by a typewriter is usually more precise, speeds up the process, and is more visually appealing than writing with a pen and ink, making it more applicable than writing with a pen.
