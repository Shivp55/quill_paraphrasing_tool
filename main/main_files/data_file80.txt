Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

1) 7.00% +4.00% = 11.0%
2) 5.00% +1.25 *6.00%= 12.5%
3) 35= 1.20/(r-.08)= 11.43%\sb) 1.50%
