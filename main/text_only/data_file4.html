Distinguish the pass and stop bands with reference to the cutoff frequency. Also, state what happens to the circuit complex impedance at the cutoff frequency. </p><br/></div><div class="container"><p><strong>Answer</strong></p><p>Total answers posted by the expert is: 1105</p>RC circuits work as filters (high-pass or low-pass filters), integrators and differentiators.<br/>The simplest RC circuit is a capacitor and a resistor in series. When a circuit consists of only a charged capacitor and a resistor, the capacitor will discharge its stored energy through the resistor. The voltage across the capacitor, which is time dependent, can be found by using Kirchhoff's current law, where the current through the capacitor must equal the current through the resistor.<br/>A stopband is a band of frequencies, between specified limits, through which a circuit, such as a filter or telephone circuit, does not allow signals to pass, or the attenuation is above the required stopband attenuation level. Depending on application, the required attenuation within the stopband may typically be a value between 20 and 120 dB higher than the nominal passband attenuation, which often is 0 dB.<br/>The lower and upper limiting frequencies, also denoted lower and upper stopband corner frequencies, are the frequencies where the stopband and the transition bands meet in a filter specification. The stopband of a low-pass filter is the frequencies from the stopband corner frequency (which is slightly higher than the passband 3 dB cut-off frequency) up to the infinite frequency. The stopband of a high-pass filter consists of the frequencies from 0 hertz to a stopband corner frequency (slightly lower than the passband cut-off frequency).<br/>Ohm's law describes the relationship between current and voltage in circuits that are in equilibrium- that is, when the current and voltage are not changing. When we have a situation where the current changes (often called an AC circuit) more factors have to be taken into account.</div><div class="true" style="display:None;"><p>3118370</p></div> <script>
