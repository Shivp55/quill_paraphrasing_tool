<p>Discuss the pros and cons of central banks setting policy based
on rules as opposed to setting policy based upon the discretion of
policymakers at each policy meeting.</p>
</p><br/></div><div class="container"><p><strong>Answer</strong></p><p>Total answers posted by the expert is: 2989</p>Central banks can affect long-term interest rates through alternative monetary policy measures, such as buying different types of securities, which pumps more money into the economy, or by offering loans to banks against different forms of collateral, such as mortgages. The Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury Department, for example, have offered loans backed by such collateral as student loans and Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. Alternative monetary policy measures such as these enhance banks' access to funding, increasing the monetary supply in times when the economy is in a deep recession, according to a report by Riksbank, the central bank in Sweden. It further reported that central banks in England and Japan have used alternative monetary policy measures in times of recession as well.<br/>There are multiple versions of more comprehensive alternative monetary policy, but the most common proposals suggest a set of rules to guide policy formulation as opposed to the almost complete discretion Fed policymakers have historically exercised. Advocates of alternative monetary policy charge that central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States or the Bank of Canada in Canada, could use monetary policy to influence elections. Policymakers could, for example, use expansionary monetary policy, which expands the money supply, to provide a short-term stimulus to production and employment in order to help a favored politician or political party win an upcoming election. Advocates of alternative monetary policy also charge that granting so much discretion to central banks gives these policymakers too much influence over the economy--influence that could be harmful if central bankers are incompetent or abuse the powers granted them.</div><div class="true" style="display:None;"><p>3119968</p></div> <script>
