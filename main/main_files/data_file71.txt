Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

The equation represents the demand for a commodity. P = 10 - .2Qd
P = 2 + given.2Qs Qs = Qd\s2 + . 2Qs = 10 - . 2Qd
Equilibrium price = 2 + when Qs = Qd = 20.
2Qs = 10 - .
Equilibrium quantity equals 20 when 2Qd = 6 3119390
