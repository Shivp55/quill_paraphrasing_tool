Question
Gold, which has a density of 19.32 g/cm3, is the most ductile metal and can be pressed into a thin leaf or drawn out into a long fiber. (a) If a sample of gold with a mass of 7.705 g, is pressed into a leaf of 5.949 ?m thickness, what is the area (in m2) of the leaf? (b) If, instead, the gold is drawn out into a cylindrical fiber of radius 2.500 ?m, what is the length (in m) of the fiber? explain

Answer

1) Since h= u2 /2g g= 9.8 and h= 2.29 m overall, which is greater than 3.53 m in height, the ball will reach the top.
2) h =3.53-1.65=1.88 m; hence, v2 =6.72 -2*9.8*1.88; this results in a top velocity of v =2.84 m/s; and 3) for a ball thrown, v2 =6.7+2*9.8*1.88; this results in v =9.04 m/s; so, the change in speed is 9.04-6.7 =2.34 m/s 3120872
