Ink ribbons were generally affordable and some used reusable ink ribbons that were very economical to use. Another decent characteristic of the typewriter was that it did not require power supply and so it was dependable during power failures.  Furthermore, using the printer did not cause eyestrain even if someone has used it for a lengthy amount of time. <br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>Typewriters did not only have positive features but rather negative ones as well. <br/>Typewriters did not have the facility of erasing a letter or fixing what has been writing as it was difficult to make any corrections. Written documents had to be emailed or delivered since emailing through internet was not yet present. Only one copy can be created at a time and no illustrations could be added. Moreover, typewriters have a lack of storing written documents. <br/></p><br/></div><div class="container"><p><strong>Answer</strong></p><p>Total answers posted by the expert is: 784</p>The acceptability of typewriter in the society increased gradually due to its positive aspects.<br/>PROS<br/>1.The permanence of typewriters giving the users a hard copy printout with decipherable handwriting is one of the most important positive aspects.<br/>2.Economical and reusable ink ribbons are another asset.<br/>3.Non-dependance on power supply.Moreover eye-strained caused even after prolonged use in very less.<br/>CONS of using typewriter are also there.<br/>1.Non-erasable ink making it difficult to make corrections.<br/>2.Documents had to be mailed or delivered unlike nowadays where documents can be directly emailed.<br/>3.Production of only one copy at one time and that too without being able to add any further illustrations.<br/>4.Typewriters are also incapable of storing documents<br/></div><div class="true" style="display:None;"><p>3119244</p></div> <script>
