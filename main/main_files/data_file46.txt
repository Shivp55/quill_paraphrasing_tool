Answer

threat of new rivalry
A threat of inferior goods or services
the purchasing power of consumers (buyers)
Suppliers' negotiating power
Competitive rivalry intensity
The combination of these five forces acts to reduce overall profitability in a "unattractive" industry.
The attractiveness of the industry as a whole does not guarantee that every company will be profitable. Businesses can use their core strengths, business strategy, or network to generate profits that are higher than the sector average. The airline business is an excellent illustration of this. Although the profitability of the sector as a whole is low, certain companies have been able to outperform it by using innovative business methods.
