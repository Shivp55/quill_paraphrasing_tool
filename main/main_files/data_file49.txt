Answer

Due of its advantages, the typewriter's acceptance in society grew gradually.
One of the most significant pros is that typewriters are permanent and always produce hard copies with legible handwriting.
2. Reusable and affordable ink ribbons are another benefit.
3. Independence from the electrical grid.
However, even after lengthy use, very little eye strain was still present.
The use of a typewriter also has drawbacks.
1. Errors are challenging to make with non-erasable ink.
2.Unlike now, when documents may be sent directly via email, documents had to be mailed or delivered.
3.Only one copy can be produced at a time, and that too without the ability to include more pictures.
4.Typewriters can't store documents either.
